# Turbofan-Predictive-Maintenance-NASA-
This project analyzes the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines. 
By leveraging advanced data processing techniques and machine learning, the project aims to provide insights for predictive maintenance.

Key Features
#Dataset Exploration: Loaded and examined datasets containing sensor readings and engine cycles for multiple engines.
#Preprocessing: Applied techniques like missing value imputation, normalization, and feature scaling to prepare the data.
#Visualization: Used libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore data trends and correlations.
#Predictive Modeling: (If applicable) Developed models to predict RUL using machine learning algorithms.
Technologies Used
#Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
#Dataset: NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset.
#Tools: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
